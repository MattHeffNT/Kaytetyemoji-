                    <strong>How do I use Indigemoji stickers</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you’re reading this, then you’ve already managed to download this app. You
                    can now look through the different emoji stickers and share them in text
                    messages, WhatsApp, Messenger or on some social media platforms. On iOS
                    platforms they also function as a sticker pack, allowing for integration onto
                    your phone. Because they are stickers, they can’t be used in-line with text on
                    social media platforms - instead they will behave more like images.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Why don’t they behave exactly like normal emojis?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Good question. Emojis were originally developed in Japan before being adopted,
                    expanded and used around the world. The official emoji set is now controlled by
                    Unicode, an international consortium that chooses which emojis are adopted into
                    the official set. To get a new emoji adopted into the official set, you need to
                    go through an extensive application process, a process which recently rejected a
                    key symbol of Aboriginal Australia, the Aboriginal Flag. Therefore we’ve made
                    our own sticker set to reflect our own language and culture.

                    <strong>How were the stickers made?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The concepts and artworks were made during eight weeks of free digital art
                    workshops at the Alice Springs Public Library, overseen by a group of senior
                    Arrernte advisers. The workshops ran all day every day of the summer 2018-2019
                    school holidays with a team of youth workers and Indigenous artists. We also
                    worked with local art centres and other Indigenous organisations to make certain
                    emojis. All artists and advisers were paid for their time and contribution. We
                    then worked with a graphic designer to help us polish our final designs,
                    learning some advanced graphic design skills along the way. The app was made by
                    ingeous studios in Cairns, an Indigenous-owned and run technology and design
                    company. The workshops were funded by inDigiMOB and the Northern Territory
                    Government. See full credits for the project{' '}

                <p>
                    <strong>What language are the emojis in?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are many different dialects of Arrernte spoken today. The language of the
                    emoji set is Eastern and Central Arrernte spoken around Mparntwe/Alice Springs,
                    Amoonguna, Ltyentye Apurte/Santa Teresa and Titjikala. To find our more about
                    the emojis and to hear an audio pronunciation of each emoji name{' '}

                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Why did we make them?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our aim is to share a slice of Arrernte culture with the world and increase our
                    representation on digital platforms. Each emoji has been carefully thought
                    through, developed and approved by a group of senior Arrernte advisers and other
                    community members. We want our kids to feel that their language and culture is
                    relevant and that they have opportunities in this new digital world.

                        Why aren’t there any stickers relating to the sea or other parts of
                        Australia?
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    These stickers were made with young people, artists and linguists on Arrernte
                    country in Central Australia. They predominantly relate to Arrernte life and
                    culture. We would not presume to represent the culture or language of other
                    communities. We would love to share everything we’ve learnt and help others make
                    their own emoji stickers! If that’s you, just get in touch!

                <p>
                    Indigemoji is a collaborative team that worked together to produce this app. The

                    artist involved. They have licensed the use of their work to be included and
